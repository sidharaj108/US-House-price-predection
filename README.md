# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to use **Linear Regression** to predict median house values based on the **California Housing dataset**. It covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. The goal is to provide a beginner-friendly introduction to regression modeling.

## 📂 Dataset

* **Source**: California Housing dataset (`sklearn.datasets`)
* **Features**: Average number of rooms, population, median income, location-based values, etc.
* **Target**: Median house value

## ⚙️ Methodology

1. **Data Loading** – Importing dataset using `fetch_california_housing`.
2. **Exploration** – Checking dataset shape, features, and correlations.
3. **Splitting** – Dividing into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
4. **Model Training** – Using `LinearRegression` from `scikit-learn`.
5. **Evaluation** – Measuring accuracy with:

   * Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   * R² Score
6. **Visualization** – Scatter plot of Actual vs Predicted values.

## 📊 Results

* The model successfully predicts housing prices with a reasonable accuracy.
* Evaluation metrics (MSE and R² Score) show how well the model performs.
* Visualization provides clear insights into prediction accuracy.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Implement advanced regression models (Ridge, Lasso, Decision Trees).
* Perform feature scaling for better accuracy.
* Add hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
* Extend project with real-world datasets.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas & NumPy** (Data handling)
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Visualization)
* **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning)

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

* How to load and prepare datasets.
* Applying Linear Regression for prediction tasks.
* Evaluating models using performance metrics.
* Visualizing results for better understanding.

👉 This README is clean and structured for GitHub. Do you want me to also **add a "Usage" section** (with code snippets showing how to run the notebook)? That would make it easier for others to use your project.
